# DEV Project Milestone 1 + 2

## Milestone 1

The goal of the milestone 1 is to go through the complete data engineering process to answer questions about the dataset. 

In milestone 1 we will be:
- Exploring the data
- Finding our research questions
- Cleaning our data 
- Visualizing our data

Decriptive markdown of our code cells are provided.

Our Final Research questions were:

1. We've established that some of the numerical features are correlated to each other so how can we predict a features based on another feature. For example (Power_HP vs Price)(Power_HP vs Displacement)(Production_year vs Price)(Mileage vs Price)(Displacement vs Price)(Production_year vs Mileage).
2. What month are most offers made in?
3. What affect does Price and Displacmenet have when the vehicle's Power_HP increases
4. What affect does Price and Mileage have when Production_year increases?
5. What features are affect by a combination of other feautres?
6. Do clients prefer a certain colour?
7. Does a certain feature increase the price of a car?
8. What features are most preferred?
9. How does the tranmission and fuel type change based on different brands?
10. What attibute are different brands most focused on?
11. What attribute determines the brand's pricing?
12. Does the average price change based on colour, drive or fuel type?
13. Can we predict the price based on other attributes?


## Milestone 2

For milestone 2 we will be performing the following tasks:

- Data Integration
- Data Cleaning 
- Feature Engineering 
- Analysis

Visualization will be shown as well as markdown cells explaining the insights we gained from the graph.
